          "message": "ci: upgrade and pin to ubuntu-22.04 project-wide for CI runner images\n\n1. This does not upgrade all the container images that we build and publish\nas part of the project, it just upgrades the runner images that are being\nused by the continuous integration environment.\n2. I also deleted a .yaml file that I left in the diff of another pull request\nby accident. Apologies for the littering.\n3. Upgrade: as-in, I bumped the 20.04 versions to 22.04\n4. Pin: as-in, replaced `ubuntu-latest` with `ubuntu-22.04` everywhere.\n5. Reasoning: 24.04 is out now and so we have to keep up with the times\nbecause soon there'll be a stop to security patches even on what used to\nbe LTS (20.04). It is better to find out now if we have a problem with\nubuntu 22.04 rather than later when it's become urgent to upgrade.\n6. The risk of something breaking because of these upgrades is most likely\nlow since ubuntu is one of the most stable distributions out there.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
